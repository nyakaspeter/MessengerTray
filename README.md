# MessengerTray / FacebookTray

One day Facebook decided to disable the messenger interface on their desktop site (which I like far more than the standalone messenger.com) for my account. It has been re-enabled since, but in the meantime I needed something quickly to replicate the functionality on my pc. So I came up with **MessengerTray**, a simple Electron app that can spawn messenger.com windows near the system tray area for selected chats.

Once the facebook.com messenger interface was re-enabled for me, I also created **FacebookTray**, which aims to bring the said interface to be usable outside the browser (well, it's technically still in a browser, just invisible). It's obviously more fleshed out than my solution of putting messenger windows beside each other, so I advise to use this version, whenever possible.

For now, only the main chat functionality is usable, calls, external links and such can break the app. Also, using the app can become impossible any time Facebook decides to update their site.
